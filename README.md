# Gutenberg Slider

This is a plugin that adds sliders to the Gutenberg editor! It introduces two new blocks:

* Gutenberg slider container
* Gutenberg slider block

## What The Blocks Do

### Gutenberg Slider Container

This is the wrapper for the slider. All blocks that are direct descendents of this wrapper block will be the slides. All block types are supported.

### Gutenberg Slider Block

A special block that is designed to be used in the slider container. This contains a media selector, which you can use to select a background for the slider. There is also a section for adding child blocks, which will be the slider content displayed over the background. 

All options for child blocks (such as text settings) are honored. So you can still set color, font size, etc for your content to create rich content.
